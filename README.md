# Daniel Webb
I'm Junior aspiring full stack developer, leaning more towards front-end.

I enjoy the logic challenges and problems that programming brings, I love technology and I like figuring stuff out myself.

I'm self-driven, hard-working and easy-going. I also hold two CFGS (Higher technician) degrees in Systems Administration and Multiplatform Application Development.

# Experience:
## IT shop teller/PHP programmer in a Local Shop(2018-3 months)
I created a simple ticket generating program for inventory management. This was my first intro into programming an actual usable application. With absolutely no experience and no help. I was very proud of this program as it was my first, it was definitely very poorly coded and full of bugs, but it worked! Not bad for a first timer in PHP no doubt... 

## IT Technician/Programmer at a Real Estate Franchise(2020-2021)
I worked with various different languages and technologies:
  * Python 
(Telegram bot)
  * Javascript/Node.js 
(I started a web app for automating Google My Business Posts, this project in the end wasn't needed and was scraped)
  * OAuth2 authentication (For previous project)
  * PHP and Javascript (For an Interactive map)
  * PowerBi and Excel
  * SQL
  * Docker
 * Mysql/SQL Server
  * Linux

# Projects I've coded:
### [Console Wallapop](https://github.com/daninfocus/Wallapop-Consola) 
Made in Java still in progress, soon to be [web app](https://github.com/daninfocus/WEBBAPOP) and further on, a mobile app in Flutter.

### [Telegram bot](https://github.com/daninfocus/Python-Telegram-Bot)
With Python it gets data from properties that have been modified in the last 24 hours, and sends a message to 1 of 4 telegram groups with different price ranges Python.

### Google My Business Post Automation
Web app with OAuth2 login, that from a list of properties, gathers it's data, and posts it on to the account's Google My Business profile, has a post, this involves using Google My Business API, a OAuth2 workflow and this runs on Node.js, with bootstrap for the front-end.
