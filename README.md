# Daniel Webb
I'm Junior full stack developer, leaning more towards back-end.

I enjoy the logic challenges and problems that programming brings, I love technology and I like figuring stuff out myself.

I'm self-driven, hard-working and easy-going. I also hold two CFGS (Higher technician) degrees in Systems Administration and Multiplatform Application Development.

Experience:
IT shop teller/PHP programmer Local Shop(2018-3 months)
I created a simple ticket generating program for inventory management. This was my first intro into programming an actual usable application. With absolutely no experience and no help. I was very proud of this program as it was my first, it was definitely very poorly coded and full of bugs, but it worked! Not bad for a first timer in PHP no doubt... 

IT Technician/Programmer Real Estate Franchise(2020-2021)
I worked withrious different languages and technologies:
  Python (Telegram bot)
  Javascript/Node.js (I started a web app for automating Google My Business Posts, this project in the end wasn't needed and was scraped)
  Oauth authentication (For previous project)
  PHP and Javascript (For an Interactive map)
  PowerBi and Excel
  SQL
  Docker
  Mysql/SQL Server
  Linux

Projects I've coded:
Console Wallapop (In progress, soon to be web app and further on, a mobile app in Flutter) Java
